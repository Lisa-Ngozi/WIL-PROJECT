# WIL-PROJECT
This repository showcases a front-end web application I developed for my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) project. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates my ability to create a functional and responsive interface. The project reflects my front-end skills and my creativity in designing intuitive digital experiences.
